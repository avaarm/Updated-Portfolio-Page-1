### Updated Portfolio

The updated site should have the following content:

* My Name

* Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number

* A link to a PDF of your resume

* A list of projects. For each project, make sure you have the following:

  * Project title

  * Link to the deployed version

  * Link to the GitHub repository

  * Screenshot of the deployed application


#### Design


* Mobile-first design

* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like
the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site - I chose a transparent background becuase I wanted to the page to be simple and easy to read. 

* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.


### Updated GitHub Profile 


 * Profile picture - Do not feel as comfortable with a personal photo on github so I have a photo of some ancient stonehenges from Armenia.

 * Bio - "An immunology and microbiology researcher currently enrolled in a Full Stack Web development program, hoping to explore a career in technology"

 * Location - Seattle, WA

 * Email - avaarm95@gmail.com

 * Link to your portfolio - [MyPortfolio](https://avaarm.github.io/Updated-Portfolio-Page-1/)


 * Pin some repos that you want to highlight - completed

 * Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and go to your profile.

 * Click "Customize your pins"

 * Click the checkboxes for your project and 2-3 homework assignments that you would like to share

 * Make sure each of these projects is deployed and add a link to the deployed project in their README files

 * Follow your classmates. They are the beginning of your professional network and being a developer is as much about being a part of the community as it is writing code. 


### Updated Resume 

I am currently unsure of the type of industry I will be entering once I finish this program, so I will be submitting a resume that is a combination of my research background and that of the certificate program.
